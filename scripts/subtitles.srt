1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:08,00
Fly me to the moon, let me play among the stars

2
00:00:08,00 --> 00:00:16,00
Let me see what springs like on a Jupiter and Mars

3
00:00:16,00 --> 00:00:24,00
In other words, hold my hand

4
00:00:24,00 --> 00:00:32,00
In other words, baby kiss me

5
00:00:32,00 --> 00:00:40,00
Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore

6
00:00:40,00 --> 00:00:48,00
You are all I long for, all I worship and adore

7
00:00:48,00 --> 00:00:56,00
In other words, please be true

8
00:00:56,00 --> 00:01:12,00
In other words, I love you

9
00:01:12,00 --> 00:01:46,00
Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore

10
00:01:46,00 --> 00:01:54,00
You are all I long for, all I worship and adore

11
00:01:54,00 --> 00:02:02,00
In other words, please be true

12
00:02:02,00 --> 00:02:20,00
In other words, I love you
